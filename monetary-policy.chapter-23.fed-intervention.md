**5 different types of lags that may hinder the effectiveness of policy**
1. Data Lag
	* Ex. GDP collected on quarterly basis
	* Have to wait
	* May not have data on some months due to quarterly basis
2. Recognition Lag
	* After recieving data, it takes time to verufy the data is correct
	* For NEBR:
		* Private research company based in Cambridge, MA
		* They will not announce a recessison is occuring until 6-12 months later
3. Legislative Lag
	* Takes time to formulate new policy.  Especially true for fiscal policy
4. Implementation Lag
	- It may take time for the government to change its spending habit
5. Effectiveness Lag
	- Takes time for the new plicy to exert its full effect on the economy
	- Monetary policy on average takes 6-10 quarters
